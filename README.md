# Openforce
This is project to make something similar to Broforce with some fixes and ability to add mods.

I will be using Godot for this.

Remember to check **Broforce** first! It's really cool game


## TODO
- Find other way to apply Chromatic Abberation on moving Stars (current one is screen space shader and because of this my UI would need to be inside CanvasLayer)
