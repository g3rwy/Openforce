# Openforce
This is project to make something similar to Broforce with some fixes and ability to add mods.

I will be using Godot for this.

Remember to check **Broforce** first! It's really cool game


## TODO
- Find other way to apply Chromatic Abberation on moving Stars (current one is screen space shader and because of this my UI would need to be inside CanvasLayer)
- Make better title sprite, this one is only placeholder
- How to make buttons and title not affected by screen space shader? If they are inside CanvasLayer they aren't clickable anymore and if they are outside it they are affected by shader
